<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

<h4>Kinetic Sculpture</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

A fun fact about me is that I am a cat person. One of my favorite cats is the stuffed tiger from the popular cartoon strip 'Calvin and Hobbes.' 
<p class = "margin"></p>
Hobbes and his friend Calvin like to go out and sled sometimes:

I would like to make a kinetic sculpture that captures the essence of these sled rides. 
<p class = "margin"></p>
My first idea was to make a desktop rollercoaster:

<img src="./DesktopRollercoaster.jpg" alt="This is a lot of work!" class="tool-box-pic">

But this won't work due to my lack of time (and skills!)

 <p class = "margin"></p>
Here is my second idea: 

<img src="./SledSketch.jpeg.jpg" alt="If you can't see this it's alright" class="tool-box-pic">

I know this drawing is beautiful but I've signed it so you can't steal it.
 <p class = "margin"></p>

 okay so let's get started recreating this sled:
