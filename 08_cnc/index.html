<h3>Assignment: Make Something With CNC</h3>

<h4> Alrighty so it's cnc week, and once again, I'm starting way too late on this assingment. However, I know what I would like to do! I really need a place to store my headphones in my dorm, because currently there's no place for them in my room. I'm currently on pinterest and this is what I'm going for: 

<img src="./PinterestWallMount.jpeg" alt="I searched up 'headphone wall mount' on pinterest"  class="tool-box-pic">

Okay? However here's the catch: I would like for it to be in the shape of the letter 'O' because that's the first initial of my last name! but also, if it goes well, maybe I'll make the letter 'A' as well? My first name starts with the letter A. That would be cute because my partner's first initial is 'O,' so maybe we can have matching headphone wall mounts where mine says 'A' and his says 'O'. OK. Let's get started....<br></br>

It honestly took me a while to try and use fusion 360 to come up with a design so I'm going to use the STL file from this design as a starting off point: 

<img src="./WallMountStartingPoint.jpeg" alt="Wall Mount Starting Point"  class="tool-box-pic">

I feel as though it looks super similar to the letter o shape that I'm going for. Here's the link where I found it: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2835111<br></br>

Okay I've used this STL file as a base for my initials: 

<div class="container mt-4">
    <div class="row">
      <!-- First Image -->
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <img src="./AO1.jpeg" alt="AO1" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
      <!-- Second Image -->
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <img src="./AO2.jpeg" alt="AO2" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
      <!-- Third Image -->
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <img src="./AO3.jpeg" alt="AO3" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  Now I need to learn how to turn this into a mold... My plan is to 3-d print these models and then vaccuum form them. let's do it. <br></br>

  The STL file is too large to print so actually there's going to be a plan b!
